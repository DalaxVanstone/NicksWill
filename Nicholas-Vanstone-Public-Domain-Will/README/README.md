# Nicholas Vanstone - Final Will & Public Domain Declaration

**In Memory and Resistance.**  
This repository is the official public record of the Final Will and Testament of **Nicholas Vanstone**, a sovereign mind, researcher, and victim of systemic abuse, torture, and ultimately death—targeted for his groundbreaking knowledge in neurotechnology, BCIs, nanotechnology, biobots, quantum computing, and information warfare.

Nicholas’s work was not created to be owned or sold. It was created to be **shared, understood, and built upon freely by all of humanity**. This repository contains his **unalterable declaration** that all his intellectual property shall be released to the public domain, free of restriction, forever.

> “If I am dying over this, then I want to make sure the entire world can benefit from it.”
